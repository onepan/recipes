## Ingredients
- [ ] 130g all-purpose flour
- [ ] 130g [hard red wheat flour](https://www.gristandtoll.com/product/hard-red-wheat/)
- [ ] 80g rye flour
- [ ] 120g starter
- [ ] 245g water
- [ ] 12g salt

## Method
### Autolyse
Mix the flour and water just until they combine. The dough will be super shaggy. Let it rest for **30-60 minutes**

### Mix
Add the starter and salt and mix at speed `2`or `3` for **~8 minutes**, at least until everything is homogenous. Transfer to a lightly oiled container for bulk fermentation.

### Bulk fermentation
Ferment for **~4 hours**. Do two sets of folds, the first at least 30 minutes after starting fermentation and the second at least 30 minutes after that but with at least 90 minutes remaining. Generally do a bowl/coil fold followed by a bowl fold. 

### Shape & proof
Start preheating the oven to **245$\degree$C / 475$\degree$F** along with dutch oven or pizza stone. If you use a pizza stone, put a cast iron or other heat retentive contraption on the rack below. 

Tighten up the dough and put in a proofing basket for **~1 hour**. Toward the end of the time, check to see if it's ready. Depending on temperature it might be ready after 45 minutes or might take 90.

### Bake
Score the loaf and bake for **~45 minutes** or until the crust is nicely colored. If you use a stone, add boiling water to the cast iron pan immediately after adding the dough.
