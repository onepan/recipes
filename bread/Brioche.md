## Ingredients
- [ ] 200g (~60%) all-purpose flour
- [ ] 150g (~40%) [hard red wheat flour](https://www.gristandtoll.com/product/hard-red-wheat/)
- [ ] 140g (~40%) starter
- [ ] 120g (~35%) butter
- [ ] 140g (~40%) eggs (3)
- [ ] 100g (~30%) whole milk
- [ ] 32g (~10%) sugar
- [ ] 8g (~2.3%) salt (use 6g if you use salted butter)

## Method
### Incorporation
Take out the butter from the fridge and cut into $\frac{1}{2}''$ pats and place in a small bowl. Let the butter come up to room temperature while doing the rest.

Whisk the sugar, eggs, milk, and starter together.

Add the salt and flour. Switch to dough hook attachment and mix on `STIR` for **~3 minutes** until it's fully combined. The dough should look very shaggy but not overly stiff. Might need to add some more milk if it's too dry.

Let the dough rest for **10 minutes**.

### Butter incorporation
Mix for **~5 minutes** on speed `4` (four notches above `STIR`) until the dough comes together and starts to pull from the sides of the bowl. It'll still be sticky but getting smoother.

Butter should be soft to touch but not melty, not cold or it'll be hard to incorporate. Turn down the speed to `2` or `3` and add the butter one pat at a time. Add a pat only after the previous pat is fully incorporated. 

Transfer to a container for bulk fermentation

### Bulk fermentation
Total fermentation time around **3 hours**. Do two sets of folds, the first at least 30 minutes after starting fermentation and the second at least 30 minutes after that but with at least 90 minutes remaining. Generally do a bowl/coil fold followed by a bowl fold.

### Divide, shape, & proof
Separate into 3 equal portions, then shape into tight balls. Put them all into a Pullman pan or loaf pan. Use as little extra flour as possible. 

Proof for **2-3 hours**.

### Bake
Preheat the oven to **220$\degree$C / 425$\degree$F**.

Make an egg wash using 1 egg and a bit of cream or milk. Brush the egg wash onto the dough before baking.

Bake for **45-60 minutes** or until you get an internal temperature of **90$\degree$C / 190$\degree$F**.

## Notes
- If you don't use any whole wheat flour, you'll need a bit less milk. Try with 90g and add more if it's too dry.
