# recipes

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to edit and organize the markdown files. If you don't use that, some things might not render correctly. In particular, links to other recipes would just show up as `[[other recipe]]` instead of an actual link. Not sure if there's any other feature unique to Obsidian.
